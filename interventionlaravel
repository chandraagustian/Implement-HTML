Installing Intervention Image

$ composer require intervention/image

See http://image.intervention.io/getting_started/installation

Now when we have our extra packages installed we need to inform Laravel that we want access them in our application.

Add to configuration file ../config/app.php

 'providers' => [

    // ...
      Intervention\Image\ImageServiceProvider::class,
    // ...
  ],

'aliases' => [
    // ...
      'Image'     => Intervention\Image\Facades\Image::class,
    // ...
  ],

OK. At this point weâ€™re done with configuration.
